The Payload was designed to use two separate hubs, that are physically connected, one for defending, which would move the payload towards the attacker's base, and one for attacking, which would move the payload towards the defender's base. This was so that the Payload could have 3 sensors for each side. Though, it probably would have been better with one hub and 2 sensors for each side, instead. This is because when the robot motors are pushing against each other, they effectively stop the robot almost completely, regardless of which side is supposed to have more power.
The Duelist has more speed and less health, while the Vanguard has more health and less speed.
Marvel Rivals Player is a file that combines the Duelist and the Vanguard into one file. This allows players to decide which role they want to play without switching files.
